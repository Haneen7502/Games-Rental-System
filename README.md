Games Rental System
The Games Rental System provides an easy and cost-effective way to try out new games without buying them. It allows users to rent games, making gaming more accessible and affordable.

The project involves designing an ERD, converting it into a physical model using DDL scripts, and writing SQL queries to answer key business questions like identifying the most rented game, games with no rentals last month, the top renter and vendor of the previous month, and vendors with no recent activity.

Technologies used: C# (Windows Forms) and MySQL.
